                Welcome to my first web application built using React! I've been enrolled in a web coding course for the past six months 
                and this website was the assignment due at the end of week 20. I've learned HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Worked with API's, 
                databases including mySQL, MongoDB and graphQL. Learned about Object-Oriented Programming, Object Relational Mapping and 
                Model View Controller. We're wrapping the course up with React to complete the MERN stack.
